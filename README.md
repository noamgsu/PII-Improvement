1. improve_password_finalcode.py

    Configuration: Uses analyzer_settings

    Dependencies: Imports from validations

    Purpose: This is our first detection approach. It identifies passwords that are complex and contain combinations of:

        Lowercase letters

        Uppercase letters

        Digits

        Special characters

2. improve_password2_finalcode.py

    Configuration: Uses analyzer_settings2

    Dependencies: Also uses validations

    Purpose: This is our second detection approach. It focuses on extracting passwords that are:

        Positioned near specific keywords

        Made up of digits, letters, or letters with special characters

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Instructions

    Each script should be executed separately.

    After both scripts run, verify that there are no duplicate passwords (there shouldn‚Äôt be any).

    Merge the results from both into a single output list for analysis.

üí° Recommendation

I suggest running these scripts in a separate background environment to clearly track changes ‚Äî whether positive or negative ‚Äî and assess the impact of the new detection logic.

Let me know if you'd like help setting up the environment or integrating the outputs.
